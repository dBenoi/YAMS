## About

MERN stack web application designed for network admins to use for asset management. Users are able to save useful information about network devices, such as make/model, ip address, description, and locations. This is helpful for network administrators who manage clients with multiple sites or single sites with a variety of devices. This will not replace a strong network management tool, but will be useful for data manipulation and viewing by upper management and potentially clients.
